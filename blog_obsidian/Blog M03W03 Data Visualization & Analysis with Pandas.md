# 1. INTRODUCTION:

### What is Data Visualization?

**Data Visualization** is the process of transforming raw, complex data into easy-to-understand visual formats like charts, graphs, maps, and dashboards. The main goal is to help people, from experts to non-specialists, access, analyze, and comprehend information quickly and effectively.

Instead of sifting through lengthy spreadsheets or dry numbers, data visualization allows our brains to use their powerful image processing capabilities to spot trends, patterns, and relationships within the data.

### Why is Data Visualization Necessary?

Data visualization is crucial for a variety of reasons, especially in data analysis and decision-making:

* **Improved Comprehension:** Our brains process images much faster than text. Visualizing data helps people grasp complex information in seconds, saving time and effort.
* **Identifies Trends and Patterns:** Charts and graphs highlight trends, anomalies, and relationships between variables that are often invisible in raw data. This leads to deeper insights and more valuable discoveries.
* **Faster Decision-Making:** When information is presented clearly, managers and decision-makers can get a comprehensive overview of the situation, enabling them to make timely and informed strategic decisions.
* **Enhanced Communication:** Visualized data is a powerful communication tool. It helps analysts convey their findings and messages more persuasively to stakeholders, even those without a data background.
* **Saves Time and Resources:** Automating the creation of dashboards and reports significantly reduces the time and effort required compared to manual reporting.

### Common Data Visualization Methods (Chart Types)

There are many types of charts and visualization methods, each suited for a specific analytical purpose:

* **Bar Chart:** Used to compare the values of different categories.
* **Line Chart:** Ideal for tracking changes in data over time.
* **Pie Chart:** Shows the percentage of each component within a whole.
* **Scatter Plot:** Displays the relationship between two variables.
* **Heatmap:** Uses color to represent data intensity or density, often for geographical or matrix analysis.
* **Dashboard:** A comprehensive display of key charts, graphs, and metrics that provides an at-a-glance overview of performance or business health.

Popular tools for data visualization include Tableau, Power BI, Google Data Studio, and even familiar applications like Microsoft Excel.

#PANDAS: 

Pandas is an open-source Python library designed specifically for data analysis and manipulation. Known for its speed, power, flexibility, and ease of use, Pandas is built on the **NumPy** library. It is highly effective for working with tabular data, similar to tables in SQL or spreadsheets in Excel. Pandas offers a wide range of functions for cleaning, analyzing, and modeling data, helping you discover key insights within datasets.

### Key Data Structures

Pandas provides two fundamental data structures:

* **Series**: A one-dimensional array with a labeled index, similar to a single column in a dataset.
* **DataFrame**: The most important and widely used two-dimensional table-like structure. It consists of multiple rows and columns, where each column is essentially a **Series**.

### Key Functions and Data Processing Capabilities

Pandas provides a powerful toolkit for various data analysis tasks:

* **Data Manipulation and Exploration**: It supports reading and writing data from common formats like CSV, Excel, JSON, and SQL. Functions such as `head()`, `info()`, `describe()`, and `dtypes` help quickly inspect data structure, basic statistics, and data types.

* **Data Selection and Filtering**: It offers flexible methods to access data based on labels (`.loc[]`, `.at[]`) or integer positions (`.iloc[]`, `.iat[]`).

* **Data Transformation and Aggregation**: It allows you to group data (`groupby()`) to compute aggregate statistics, sort data (`sort_values()`), and apply custom functions (`apply()`) to rows or columns.

* **Data Cleaning**: It has flexible capabilities for handling missing data by filling values (`fillna()`) or dropping them (`dropna()`). It also supports modifying data formats (e.g., converting to numbers, dates) and removing duplicate records (`drop_duplicates()`).

* **Time Series Analysis**: It integrates advanced techniques like `rolling()` for calculating statistics on moving windows and `resample()` for changing the data frequency. It also includes time-based indexing to access data by specific dates and times.

### Common Applications

Pandas is widely used in various fields:

* **Data Science**: Used for data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and feature extraction.

* **Machine Learning (ML)**: Supports normalizing and transforming input data for machine learning models.

* **Business and Financial Analysis**: Used to analyze revenue, costs, profits, and customer segments.

* **Big Data / Log Data Processing**: Helps clean, filter, and transform data from large systems.

* **Data Visualization**: Combines with other libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn to create charts and visual representations of data.

* **Office Task Automation**: Automates reading, updating, and writing reports from Excel/CSV files, streamlining day-to-day office tasks.

# 2. Pandas

Pandas is a important library in **Data Science**, **Data Analysis**, and
**Machine Learning**.

## 2.1 Installation and Import

To use Pandas, first install it:

``` {caption="Install Pandas"}
pip install pandas
```

Then, import it into your Python script:

``` {caption="Import Libraries"}
import pandas as pd
```

## 2.2 Data Loading

Pandas supports multiple common data formats.

### Read CSV File

    df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')

### Read Excel File

    df = pd.read_excel('data.xlsx', sheet_name='Sheet1')

### Read from JSON

    df = pd.read_json('data.json')

### Read from URL (public data)

    url = 'https://pandas/data/aio.csv'
    df = pd.read_csv(url)


## 2.3 Series: One-Dimensional Data Structure

A `Series` is a labeled one-dimensional array, representing a single
column of data.

### Create a Series

    ages = pd.Series([23, 25, 22, 24], name='Age')
    print(ages)

**Output:**

    0    23
    1    25
    2    22
    3    24
    Name: Age, dtype: int64

### Common Series Operations

\- `series.head(n)`: Display first $n$ elements

\- `series.tail(n)`: Display last $n$ elements

\- `series.mean()`: Compute mean

\- `series.isnull()`: Check for missing values

\- `series.fillna(value)`: Fill missing values

\- `series.astype(dtype)`: Change data type

## 2.4 DataFrame: Two-Dimensional Table

The `DataFrame` is Pandas' primary structure --- a 2D labeled data
table, similar to a spreadsheet.

## Create a DataFrame

    df = pd.DataFrame(data)
    print(df)

**Output:**

       Name  Age 
    0    An   23     
    1  Binh   25      
    2   Chi   22      
    3 Duong   24 

### Common DataFrame Operations

\- `df.head()`: First 5 rows

\- `df.tail()`: Last 5 rows

\- `df.shape`: Dimensions (rows, columns)

\- `df.columns`: Column names

\- `df.dtypes`: Data types of columns

\- `df.info()`: Summary of the DataFrame

\- `df.describe()`: Descriptive statistics

\- `df.drop_duplicates()`: Remove duplicate rows

\- `df.reset_index()`: Reset index after filtering

## 2.5 Data Retrieval

### Access Columns

    print(df['Name'])           # Series
    print(df[['Name', 'Score']]) # DataFrame

### Access Rows: `.loc[]` (by label/index)

    print(df.loc[0])                    # row 0
    print(df.loc[1:2, ['Name', 'Major']]) # rows 1â€“2, columns 'Name', 'Major'

### Access Rows: `.iloc[]` (by position)

    print(df.iloc[0])           # first row
    print(df.iloc[0:2, 0:2])    # first 2 rows, first 2 columns

### Filtering Data

    print(df[df['Age'] > 23])
    print(df[df['Major'] == 'CS'])
    print(df[(df['Major'] == 'CS') & (df['Score'] > 8.0)])

## 2.6 Data Cleaning

### Check for Missing Values

    print(df.isnull())        # True/False matrix
    print(df.isnull().sum())  # Count NaN per column

### Fill Missing Values

    df['Score'] = df['Score'].fillna(df['Score'].mean())

### Remove Duplicates

    df.drop_duplicates(inplace=True)

### Change Data Types

    df['Age'] = df['Age'].astype('int32')
    df['Major'] = df['Major'].astype('category')

### Reset Index After Filtering

    filtered_df = df[df['Score'] > 8.0]
    filtered_df = filtered_df.reset_index(drop=True)
